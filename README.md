# 📈 Linear Regression Implementation

# 📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression in Python using Scikit-learn. It covers essential steps such as data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and result visualization. The project is useful for anyone looking to understand and apply linear regression techniques effectively.

# 🔍 Key Features

**Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.

**Model Training** – Implementing Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.

**Performance Metrics** – Evaluating the model using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.

**Visualization** – Scatter plots, regression line plotting, and residual analysis.
